        <h3>Diani Beach &ndash; Kenya</h3>
        <p class="text-justify"><strong>Diani Beach</strong> is a major beach resort on the Indian Ocean coast of Kenya. <strong>Diani Beach</strong> is located 30 kilometers south of <strong>Mombasa</strong>, in the nearby <strong>Kwale County</strong> &ndash; Diani popularity with tourists has rendered the area an ever-growing assortment of beach hotels, Apartments hostels, bars and Diani restaurants. Yet, it&rsquo;s privacy and seclusion are maintained, making it the perfect beach escape. Diani Beach is a 10 km stretch of fine, white, glistening sand surrounded by azure waters. Diani Beach is one of the most captivating places you will ever visit, when tides are shallow reefs reveal an exquisite world of sea life right at your feet. Scurrying crabs retreat to their hiding places as you wade through the crystalline waters. The lush rainforest at its fringes only adds to the picture-postcard atmosphere. Sea salt lingers in the air; fresh coconuts reappear in your hands and time truly appears frozen. Diani Beach is deservedly one of the most beautiful beaches in the world, as one of Kenya's most popular holiday destinations, in addition, various activities are offered: From camel riding to diving on the coral reefs, drinking a fresh coconut on the beach to sipping cocktails at a beach bar: <strong>Diani Beach</strong> leaves no wish unfulfilled, because the infrastructure and the service on the beach make a relaxed, carefree stay possible for you. <strong>Mombasa Airport</strong> is about 42 km north of the beach. It is the second most important airport in Kenya and is served by various international airlines. Almost all beach travelers arrive at this airport in Kenya. It is advisable to withdraw money directly at the airport and buy a Kenyan SIM card, if necessary, the <strong>hotels in Diani Beach</strong> usually offer a pick-up service from the airport. If not, a taxi can be taken. As everywhere in Kenya, it is important to negotiate the price of the taxi ride before boarding. Some taxi drivers have a price table in the car, which was made by the hotels. This prevents excessive prices from being demanded. A taxi ride from Mombasa airport to Diani Beach cost between 60 and 80 euros, as in the rest of Kenya, some Tuktuks and Boda-Bodas also drive along Diani Beach Road. The three-wheeled vehicles with seating cabin, Tuktuk, and the motorcycle taxi, Boda-Boda, are considerably cheaper than a normal taxi. This also saves comfort. The price must be negotiated in advance. Along the Diani beach there are various possibilities to buy small souvenirs and souvenirs. At the stands there are fine cloths and wooden animal figures, bracelets, chains and cooking utensils. A name can be carved into some wooden objects, if you bring some waiting time. The payment of a partial amount in advance is completely normal, here there is no reason to become suspicious. On Diani Beach Road, right behind the beach and the beach hotels, there are various shopping facilities for food, clothing and electronics. The three large shopping centers are on site: The <strong>Diani Beach Shopping Center</strong>, the Baharini Shopping Center and the Nakumatt Shopping Center. In the shopping centres there are Western-style supermarkets, souvenir shops and shops where clothes can be bought. Photography is usually not permitted there. If high-quality electronic products such as batteries for the camera, chargers, etc. are required, a trip to Mombasa is indispensable. The <strong>restaurants in Diani Beach</strong> are touristic and influenced by the West. Here you will find perhaps the best restaurants for tourists on the entire Kenyan coast. Of particular interest is the "<strong>Ali Barbour's Cave Restaurant</strong>" - a restaurant which, as the name suggests, is located in a cave. The restaurant "The Sands at Nomad" also has a great location directly on the beach. There are various national and international dishes, from pizza and rice dishes to fish and seafood. A little smaller, but also recommended, is the "Lymington Bistro", which is also located on the beach. Delicious and good pasta and pizza are available in the pizzeria "Aniellos Pizzeria". The pizzeria is popular with tourists and is located directly on <strong>Diani Beach Road</strong>. Most tourists stay at in apartments during their stay. But the area around Diani Beach has many good bars that make a trip worthwhile. The "<strong>Nomads Beach Bar"</strong> offers various cocktail specialties. Especially football fans watch important games in the "Yibba Yabba Sportsbar". Relax in the "Forty Thieves Bar". The floor of this outdoor bar is completely covered with sand. While the day ends with a cocktail or Tusker beer, one enjoys the free view of the sea. Sometimes even artists come along and perform tricks for the guests. If you like it, you can leave a small tip.

Watchful tourists will notice the green rope ladders over Diani Road. They were installed by the Colobus Conservation Center to protect the monkeys of the region from being run over. More and more "monkey bridges" are being added through donations and the commitment of the company. Especially the Colobus, also known as the black and white monkey, is at the centre of the activities, alongside the southern Green Sea cat, the baboon and the White-throated Sea cat. The Colobus Conservation Center can be visited for a small entrance fee. Since the animals are reintroduced to the wild and the visitors have to keep a large distance, the visit for zoo fans is certainly a bit boring. People who want to do something for the protection of animals support the project with their entry. Various excursions and tours start from Diani Beach.

You have one of the most beautiful beaches in the world in front of you.

The length and width of the beach will save you from a sardine can experience, but it's not really authentic here. Nevertheless: <strong>Diani Beach</strong> is a celebrity and rightly so we can recommend a visit to this beach beauty with all our hearts. In front of Diani Beach there are 18 coral reefs. Boats leave at high tide so that you can dive there. The colorful reefs are definitely worth a dive. With a bit of luck, you can also see sea turtles, dolphins, rays, whale sharks, seahorses and knight fish. The best time to see this is between October and April. At low tide you can walk on the bottom of the sea. You can see starfish, sea cucumbers, sea spiders and crabs. Sea urchins, smaller moray eels and the dangerous stonefish can also be observed. Bathing shoes are an absolute must due to the highly poisonous stonefish! Depending on the season you can also see kitesurfers and windsurfers on the beach. The strongest wind blows between December and February. Some providers, such as Galu Kinondo Beach, give surf lessons or rent equipment for stand-up paddling. In the south Diani Beach borders onalu Kinondo Beach and in the north on <strong>Tiwi Beach</strong>. Compared to the other two beaches, Diani Beach is hardly to surpass in beauty. White sandy beach, clear water and a great backdrop of palm trees, greenery and beach bars make the beach perfect. This beauty is preserved by nature conservation and the <strong>Diani Chale Marine Reserve</strong>. The warm water of the Indian Ocean with a temperature around 30&deg;C takes a little getting used to. Accessing Diani Beach requires a ferry trip from <strong>Mombasa</strong>, via the <strong>Likoni Ferry</strong>, followed by a drive of around 40 minutes. The ferry ride itself does not take more than 10 minutes; however, the queue to get on is unpredictable, meaning you could have to wait in line for up to an hour, From Mombasa, get off the ferry and continue straight down the South Coast Road until you reach Ukunda. As you drive into Ukunda turn left onto the Diani Beach link road, it is well sign posted and Matatus all over the place. After 3km you will arrive at a &lsquo;T&rsquo; junction, turn right drive for about 1km and you will see the Diani Beach Shopping Centre on your right-hand side &ndash; It is well sign posted so you shouldn&rsquo;t have too many difficulties.

There have been occasional reports of tourists being mugged in isolated parts of the beach. Additionally, unless you are familiar with the locale, you could easily get lost. That said, the area within and around hotels or resorts usually has security personnel, but it's always best to take precautions and not venture out alone during the night.
