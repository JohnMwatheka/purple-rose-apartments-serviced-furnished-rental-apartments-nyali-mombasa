            <h1>Nyali Beah Mombasa</h1>
            <p class="text-justify">Nyali is a residential area and Sub-County within Mombasa City, located on the mainland north of <strong>Mombasa County.</strong> It is connected to Mombasa Island by the <strong>New Nyali Bridge</strong>. Nyali is known for its many high-class hotels and residential houses, modern standards, and long white sand beaches making it a popular destination for both local and foreign tourists. Protected by a coral reef, <strong>Nyali Beach</strong> serves as a wide, white sand beach that's part of the Mombasa Marine Reserve. The site offers diving and snorkeling opportunities. Consistent side-shore winds make this beach a popular kite-surfing and sailing spot, and there are beach volleyball nets under the shade of palm trees. Snorkel and see a colorful variety of marine species such as crabs, starfish, and cucumber sea urchins. Sea turtles and migratory birds like crab plovers may also keep you company here. You'd hardly expect to find a well-hidden oasis of tranquility such as Nyali Beach right next to the bustling city of Mombasa; that you do is one of life's lovely surprises.&nbsp;Nyali beach is immediately north of Mombasa Island in the lovely posh neighborhood of Nyali.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6 mt-3 mb-3">
            <p class="text-justify"> You'd hardly expect to find a well-hidden oasis of tranquility such as Nyali Beach right next to the bustling city of Mombasa; that you do is one of life's lovely surprises.&nbsp;Nyali borders Tudor creek in the South and Bamburi Beach in the north. This beach is truly stunning: long and wide with glittering white soft sands, soothing sea breezes and amazing coral scenery - it is very well maintained and is always kept spotless. A place to enjoy some of the most beautiful views of the Indian Ocean that Africa has to offer. Lie back with something cool to drink and watch the dhows make their way to and from the nearby old port. A little farther away big ships enter and leave the main Kenyan harbor of Mombasa.&nbsp;Most people and families love this beach for picnics and beach outings - its romantic natural setting, with its backdrop of tropical palm trees and rocky cliffs, make it perfect for a day at the beach. Kids love it for the great sand (perfect for sandcastles), calm and shallow sea and the thrill of running after the cute and harmless little ghost crabs (which inhabit most of the beach).&nbsp;Nyali Beach lies within Mombasa Marine Park Reserve and bustles with activities on summer weekends. On weekdays, you can easily find plenty of spots to relax and enjoy the serene beach.&nbsp;The upper side of Nyali beach is Mombasa Beach, which is the most visited side. The two beaches are only separated by a medium sized coral rock. During high tides, crossing to either side is difficult and risky - even if you are a very good swimmer. But at low tide, the rocky coral is beautiful to explore. There are a few beach boys and vendors at the beach selling beautiful African fabrics and artifacts. Unlike on some other beaches, on Nyali Beach their numbers are strictly controlled and they really do sell some fabulous items. Bargain with them and you'll likely pick up a memorable souvenir of your time in my country for a great price. The beach is in the affluent leafy suburb of Nyali, with modern shopping malls, a cinema complex (Nyali Cinemax), financial services and other interesting scenic sites like Mamba Village (The biggest croc farm in Africa), Nyali Golf Club and the Dwarika Dham Hindu temple all nearby.

        <p class="text-justify">Nyali is a residential area and Sub-County within Mombasa City, located on the mainland north of <strong>Mombasa County.</strong> It is connected to Mombasa Island by the <strong>New Nyali Bridge</strong>. Nyali is known for its many high-class hotels and residential houses, modern standards, and long white sand beaches making it a popular destination for both local and foreign tourists. Protected by a coral reef, <strong>Nyali Beach</strong> serves as a wide, white sand beach that's part of the Mombasa Marine Reserve. The site offers diving and snorkeling opportunities. Consistent side-shore winds make this beach a popular kite-surfing and sailing spot, and there are beach volleyball nets under the shade of palm trees. Snorkel and see a colorful variety of marine species such as crabs, starfish, and cucumber sea urchins. Sea turtles and migratory birds like crab plovers may also keep you company here. You'd hardly expect to find a well-hidden oasis of tranquility such as Nyali Beach right next to the bustling city of Mombasa; that you do is one of life's lovely surprises.&nbsp;Nyali beach is immediately north of Mombasa Island in the lovely posh neighborhood of Nyali. You'd hardly expect to find a well-hidden oasis of tranquility such as Nyali Beach right next to the bustling city of Mombasa; that you do is one of life's lovely surprises.&nbsp;Nyali borders Tudor creek in the South and Bamburi Beach in the north. This beach is truly stunning: long and wide with glittering white soft sands, soothing sea breezes and amazing coral scenery - it is very well maintained and is always kept spotless. A place to enjoy some of the most beautiful views of the Indian Ocean that Africa has to offer. Lie back with something cool to drink and watch the dhows make their way to and from the nearby old port. A little farther away big ships enter and leave the main Kenyan harbor of Mombasa.&nbsp;Most people and families love this beach for picnics and beach outings - its romantic natural setting, with its backdrop of tropical palm trees and rocky cliffs, make it perfect for a day at the beach. Kids love it for the great sand (perfect for sandcastles), calm and shallow sea and the thrill of running after the cute and harmless little ghost crabs (which inhabit most of the beach).&nbsp;Nyali Beach lies within Mombasa Marine Park Reserve and bustles with activities on summer weekends. On weekdays, you can easily find plenty of spots to relax and enjoy the serene beach.&nbsp;The upper side of Nyali beach is Mombasa Beach, which is the most visited side. The two beaches are only separated by a medium sized coral rock. During high tides, crossing to either side is difficult and risky - even if you are a very good swimmer. But at low tide, the rocky coral is beautiful to explore. There are a few beach boys and vendors at the beach selling beautiful African fabrics and artifacts. Unlike on some other beaches, on Nyali Beach their numbers are strictly controlled and they really do sell some fabulous items. Bargain with them and you'll likely pick up a memorable souvenir of your time in my country for a great price. The beach is in the affluent leafy suburb of Nyali, with modern shopping malls, a cinema complex (Nyali Cinemax), financial services and other interesting scenic sites like Mamba Village (The biggest croc farm in Africa), Nyali Golf Club and the Dwarika Dham Hindu temple all nearby.

          <h3>Getting around Mombasa</h3>
          <p class="text-justify"><strong>Mombasa</strong> is actually built an island which means its roads, heavily lined with buildings, aren&rsquo;t destined for any expansion to ease the rapidly increasing volume of traffic. Everything moves at a slower, sleepier pace here anyway, and newcomers are wise if they quickly adjust to this and cease to be in a hurry &ndash; ever!&nbsp; West of the island is industrial area and the airport, connected by a bridge.&nbsp; To the north <strong>Nyali bridge</strong> connects Mombasa to what is referred to as &ldquo;the north coast&rdquo; (although all Kenya&rsquo;s coast is actually on the east of the country).&nbsp; Just north of Mombasa is the up-market suburb of Nyali.&nbsp; A little further north is Shanzu, and further north again is Mtwapa creek. This is a busy part of the coast with a north-bound road running parallel to the beaches, chock-a-block with tourist hotels, restaurants and shopping centres, until you cross Mtwapa bridge, where the surroundings become less built up until you reach Malindi, 80 miles north of Mombasa. Driving from <strong>Mombasa to Mtwapa</strong> can take anything from twenty minutes to several hours depending on Mombasa&rsquo;s unpredictable traffic jams which can be caused by anything from an accident or break down, to police checks. It is only a 300-mile drive from Nairobi: but don&rsquo;t imagine anything like European or American roads and the preferable option is probably to fly as the cost is fairly minimal at around $100 each way.&nbsp; If you the brave the drive, the roads are rough, dusty diversions alternating with a moonscape of broken tarmac and potholes.&nbsp; Add to this the terrors of the alternative Kenyan driving styles further peaking your stress levels as you creep along at a maximum of 20 mph &ndash; if the road hasn&rsquo;t been blocked by an accident.&nbsp; Sometimes, you can whistle along faster, not looking too closely at the expansive scenery because you need to focus on avoiding those thundering buses and trucks whose drivers have their own codes of road discourtesy (something to do with size = power).&nbsp; Your overall journey is likely to take 8 hours on a good day.&nbsp;That&rsquo;s one up on the overnight train which used to take at least 13 hours if it didn't break down. The &ldquo;Lunatic Line&rdquo; with its romantic associations (Out of Africa aside) has finally been replaced by a Chinese built modern version and the journey now only takes four and a half hours. flying from Nairobi to Moi International Airport often makes sense. Once there you still have the challenge of getting into town (or beyond). Nairobi driving is alarming but in Mombasa it stretches one&rsquo;s vocabulary of expletives to new limits.&nbsp; The necessary skills for driving in Mombasa (aggression and eyes in every part of your head) should be acquired pronto. In the meantime, fearless local taxi drivers (or navigators of the open, 3-wheeled affairs called tuk-tuks) can perform man oeuvres you never dreamed of and rocket your adrenalin to awesome heights. Meanwhile to the south of Mombasa the Likoni Ferry connects the island to what is called &ldquo;the south coast.&rdquo;&nbsp; Kenya&rsquo;s South coast also has lovely beaches (including the famous Diani beach) but is generally felt to be sleepier (apart from Diani).&nbsp; Those who live on the south coast fiercely defend it as &ldquo;better&rdquo; than the north coast although notably few commutes to work in Mombasa: the ferry service, which usually runs between one and three ferries, can involve a hot, sticky wait of anything between a few minutes (if you are unusually lucky) and hours.&nbsp; And few ferries run late at night so you need to time it right if you&rsquo;re returning from sampling Mombasa&rsquo;s vibrant night life.&nbsp;
